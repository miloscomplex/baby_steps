# baby_steps

Baby and toddlers, while being looked after they have diaper changes, feedings, naps & activities throughout the day. Care-Givers need a way to track the information for the children they are looking after. A User can create an account, log in, denote all of those items individually for each child, add additional children, and delete an individual child's record.

## Installation

Clone and download the entire repositories files.

```
bundle install
```
To confirm you have the correct gem files.

## Usage

In the terminal type:
```
shotgun
```

Then open a web-browser with the URL [http://localhost:9393/](http://localhost:9393/) to view the Baby Steps login page. Either use the credentials for a preexisting user.
```
email: mike@mike.com
password: 1234

```

You create a new account to start a new care-giver account.

[http://localhost:9393/registration/signup](http://localhost:9393/registration/signup)

After you log in, you will be redirected to the children page to add, remove, edit, or create a new child-log.
