# baby_steps

Baby and toddlers, while being looked after they have diaper changes, feedings, naps & activities throughout the day. Care-Givers need a way to track the information for the children they are looking after. A User can create an account, log in, denote all of those items individually for each child, add additional children, and delete an individual child's record.
